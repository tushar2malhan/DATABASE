  WHAT IS DATABASE?
It is a PLACE manipulates,creates,delete data 
THIS DATA IS STORED INSIDE COMPUTER SERVER
(eg -facebook store lot of info about us in a database
, same as ebay - u get price,product info -all via database- where the information is stored)

postgres = database engine
sql = work with databases -to give commands to databases
SYNTAX=(SELECT column_name FROM table_name)
sql is a programming language,BUILT IN 1974,very easy and powerful language

This data is stored in tables - formed by rows & columns = called SCHEMA STRUCTURE
thus we put our records in the schema structure

Relational database = relationsip with the records of table(eg- a person may or may not have a car)

POSTGRES-SQL 
object-relational database management system ()RDBMS
& its open source
[other engines-mysql-licnese,oracle-license required,sql server]

INSTALLATION
Google > postgres download > postgres windows 64 bit > install >set your password > rest click next > untick stack builder n finish off.

              CONNECTING TO DB SERVER
GUI CLIENT = PG ADMIN
CLI = COMMAND LINE - SQL SHELL
APPLICATION - SERVER SIDE 

\l = lists the databases in your server

               CREATE DATABASE & DELETE DATABASE
CREATE DATABASE NAME;
DROP DATABASE NAME;             - very dangerous command ,always have a backup


              CONNECT TO DATABASE
 \c NAME        |.   psql  -h localhost -p 5432 -u username - d database

\d = describes the tables created in the databases (with sequence tables as well)
\dt= only shows the data-tables 
 

             Inorder to create table
CREATE TABLE person(
column_name + data type + constraints(if any)
);
              DELETE TABLE 
DROP TABLE person;

       eg-

CREATE TABLE person(
id int PRIMARY KEY,                              id,name,gender             = column_name  
first_name  VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,                here varchar               = data type
last_name   VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,                not null and primary key   = are called constraints
gender      VARCHAR(8) NOT NULL,
DATE_OFBIRTH DATE / TIMESTAMP NOT NULL,
email VARCHAR(150) ,
country VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL
);

        INSERT RECORD IN YOUR TABLE
INSERT INTO person(id,first_name,last_name,gender,date_ofbirth,email,country) VALUES (1,'TUSHAR','MALHAN','MALE','2-3-1999','TUSHA@GMAIL,COM','INDIA');

\i file_location/file_name
           constraints = refers to the set of rules that are implemented on the records in table
PRIMARY KEY - WHICH UNIQUELY IDENTIFIES THE PERSON (ROW-) 
UNIQUE- WHICH SET THE RECORDS UNIQUE AND EACH ONE SHOULD HAVE A UNIQUE VALUE
DEFAULT-
NOT NULL- MEANS ANY RECORD CANT BE SET EMPTY

             wildcard in LIKE- % = which generally means anything 
_a% = means 2 letter should start with letter a
a%  = means  first letter should start with a
%a  = means last letter should end with a
(thus use them , as per your necessity)

SELECT 10 / NULLIF (2,9);

(use add /drop CONSTRAINTS TO GIVE NAME TO your CONSTRAINT)

                ADD COLUMNS 
ALTER TABLE person ADD gender VARCHAR(50); 

[WHEN ALTER /DELETE/UPDATE TABLE - ALWAYS SPECIFY THE NAME OF THE TABLE & WHERE CLAUSE]

IN - DELETE OR UPDATE FROM person where id =1
WE ALWAYS USE WHERE = OTHERWISE ALL DATA WILL BE DELETED

ALTER TABLE person ADD 	UNIQUE(id); - CREATE UNIQUE CONSTRAINT FOR THE id column

sql commands-
TCL (TRANSACTION CONTROL LANGUAGE)-INORDER TO SAVE OR EXPORT DATA          =  COMMIT , ROLLBACK,SAVEPOINT 
DCL(DATA CONTROL LANGUAGE) - GIVES AUTHORITY ACCESS TO THE DATA            =  GRANT  , REVOKE
DDL (DATA DEFINTION LANAGUAGE)- WHICH CHANGES THE TABLE                    =  ALTER  , DROP   , CREATE   , TRUNCATE
DML (DATA MANIPULATION LANGUAGE)- WHICH CHANGES THE RECORDS IN TABLE       =  UPDATE , INSERT , DELETE thus mysql

[DELETE HERE SAVES THE LOGS = FOR FUTURE BACKUP(ROLLBACK OCCURS HERE) , WHEREAS TRUNCATE-DELETES ALL RECORDS AT ONCE(ROLLBACK DON'T WORK)NO SAVE LOGS]
        
                           UPDATE TABLES
UPDATE TABLE person  SET email= 'tusha@gmail.com', name='tushar', gender = 'Male' WHERE id=1;

            ON CONFLICT - IF ANY CONFLCIT HAPPENS ,DO NOTHING OR SOMETHING
INSERT INTO person (id,first_name,last_name,gender,date_ofbirth,email,country)VALUES(1,'TUSHAR','MALHAN','Male','2020-04-05','','usa') ON CONFLICT(id) DO NOTHING;
here= it shows conflict of id(1)=id(1)- which is the primary key - thus we type
ON CONFLICT(id) DO NOTHING,
            UPSERT
ON CONFLICT(id) DO UPDATE SET email = EXLCLUDED.email;
(so whatever u provide the email with this insert command , it will be updated in the ORIGINAL RECORDS) , THUS USE = ON CONFLICT(id) UPDATE SET last_name =EXCLUDED.last_name)


            FOREIGN KEYS - USED TO JOIN 2 TABLES VIA PRIMARY KEY AND SET THEM AS ONE, AS REFERENCED
REMEMBER PRIMARY KEY (REFERENCED TABLE - CAR TABLE SHOULD BE COPIED FIRST)- THEN FOREIGN KEY (REFERENCING TABLE - PERSON WILL BE COPIED TO SERVER)
FOR DELETION ITS vice-versa ie- first foreign key table

create table car (
        id BIGSERIAL NOT NUll PRIMARY KEY ,
	make VARCHAR(50)NOT NUll,
	model VARCHAR(50)NOT NUll,
	price VARCHAR(50)NOT NUll
);

create table person (
        id BIGSERIAL NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
	first_name VARCHAR(50)NOT NUll,
	last_name VARCHAR(50)NOT NUll,
	gender VARCHAR(7)NOT NUll,
	date_ofbirth DATENOT NUll,
	email VARCHAR(50),
	country VARCHAR(50)NOT NUll,
        car_id BIGSERIAL REFERENCES car(id),
        UNIQUE(car_id)
);


             UPDATE FOREIGN KEYS 
UPDATE person SET car_id =2 WHERE id =1;
(here with the reference of the foreignn key - the car & person table is one , so u can update the car_id(person) 2 from car(id) having=1 )

            CHOOSE SPECIFIC COLUMNS FROM THE TABLE
SELECT person.first_name,car.make,car.model FROM person; 


             INNER JOINS = INORDER TO JOIN TABLES WHERE COMMON ATTRIBUTES MEET
SELECT * FROM person JOIN car ON person.car_id = car.id;
 (where person.car_id = FOREIGN KEY & car.id = PRIMARY KEY
)
             LEFT INNER JOIN = JOIN THE RECORD FROM LEFT TABLE-THAT DONT MEET ATTRIBUTE
SELECT * FROM person LEFT JOIN car ON person.car_id = car.id

SO JOINS IN NUTSHELL -

INNER JOIN = SELECT * FROM PERSON JOIN CAR ON person.id=car.car_id;
LEFT JOIN  = SELECT * FROM PERSON LEFT JOIN CAR ON person.id=car.car_id;
SELF JOIN  = SELECT T1.S_ID FROM person as t1,person as t2 WHERE T1.S_ID=T2.S_ID AND T1.C_ID <> T2.C_ID
(IT FIRST SEPERATE THE TABLE PERSON INTO 2(T1,T2) - NOW IT USE ALIAS
WHERE it joins T1 table s_id (matches =) T2 table s_id       &
AND (WHEN ITS NOT EQUAL TO<>) =  T1 TABLE OF C_ID<> T2 TABLE OF C_ID

          CHECK SPECIFIC COLUMNS AND JOIN TABLES
SELECT person.first_name,car.make,car.model FROM person JOIN car ON person.car_id=car.id;


REMEMBER - INORDER TO DELETE FOREIGN KEY
DELETE FOREIGN  KEY DATA FIRST 
(DELETE from person WHERE id = 2;       deleting foreign key 
DELETE FROM car WHERE    id  =13;)      now deleting the primary key


             EXPORTING RESULTS TO CSV- TO UR FILE
\copy (SELECT * FROM person LEFT JOIN car ON car.id=person.id) TO 'location/filename 'DELIMETER','CSV HEADER;

             CHECK THE SEQUENCE THE DATA IS NUMBERED
SELECT nextval ('person_id_seq'::regclass);
= it gives all the LOG CALL being made

              thus u can use alter SEQUENCE id_ WITH YOUR RESPECTIVE NUMBER
ALTER SEQUENCE person_id_seq RESTART WITH 10;

SELECT * FROM person person_id_seq;

              UUID UNIVERSALLY UNIQUE IDENTIFIER -EXTENSION CREATED FROM FUNCTIONS =which give unique id -impossible to track
SELECT * FROM pg_available_extensions;
(= check extensions available)
CREATE EXTENSION IF NOT EXISTS "uuid-ossp"; - extension will be created
\df = shows lists of functions
SELECT uuid_genarate_v4();       - here after select ,we type function name with version v4(), fucntion gets created

use uuid as primary keys as DATA TYPE = as it difficult for hackers to know the id
EG

\x= expanded display turn on /off - inorder to know each value given

CREATE TABLE car(
      car_uid UUID  NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
      model varchar(50),
      make   varchar(50),
      price money,
);

CREATE TABLE person;
     person_uid UUID NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
     date_of_birth DATE,
     gender VARCHAR (7) NOT NULL,
     country VARCHAR (50),
     email VARCHAR(190),
     last_name  VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
     first_name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL,
     car_uid uuid REFERENCES car(car_uid),
     UNIQUE(car_uid)

);
INSERT INTO person (person_uid,first_name,last_name,email,country,gender,date_of_birth)VALUES(uuid_generate_v4(),TUSHAR','MALHAN','tusha@gmail.com','india','male','1999-02-03') ;
INSERT INTO car(car_uid,model,make,price) VALUES(uuid_generate_v4(),'hyundai','steel','$70,000')
THIS WAY A UUID WILL BE GIVEN TO person's table id and car's table
